Dreamscape!:

In the year 1999, a corrupt megacorporation called Chronospace monopolizes the personal computer market, spying on every PC user in complete secrecy...except for a few devout Internet hackers.

You are Wade Harris, better known on-line as user.wadebraid@chronospace.eve, and you're on a journey to bust the corrupt Internet wide open for the whole World Wide Web to see, but it won't be easy. 

As you explore a multitude of chatrooms, websites, and applications, you're constantly pursued by representatives and members of Chronospace, both on-line and in the real world. 

Will you save the Internet? Or will you, quite literally, die trying?

Chronospace is upon us. Welcome them.
