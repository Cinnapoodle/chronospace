# Chronospace
Dreamscape!:

In the year 1999, a corrupt megacorporation called Chronospace monopolizes the personal computer market, spying on every PC user in complete secrecy...except for a few devout Internet hackers.

You are Wade Harris, better known on-line as user.wadebraid@chronospace.eve, and you're on a journey to bust the corrupt Internet wide open for the whole World Wide Web to see, but it won't be easy. 

As you explore a multitude of chatrooms and websites, you're constantly pursued by representatives and members of Chronospace, both on-line and in the real world. 

Will you save the Internet? Or will you, quite literally, die trying?

Chronospace is upon us. Welcome them.



Mojave!:

In 2004, 2 billion people on the planet simultaneously died overnight in a fatal digital event referred to as “The Big Boom” due to a supposed leap year bug. It was the biggest atrocity in man’s rather short history.


As a result, the Internet was condemned and largely abandoned due to fearmongering and conspiracy theories, but in 2005, one seemingly start-up company, calling itself Chronosoft, released an Internet suite, in the hopes the world would return to their screens... and it worked.


You are Jöel Kinnunen, better known online as bloodmoon@chronosoft.day, and you’re on a quest to figure out what the deal is with the Internet. Why is it so broken? Why is it so weird? Why is it so… corrupt?


Utilizing your extreme knack for technology and your advanced knowledge of Internet hacking, you will break into Chronosoft and unveil mysteries, information and atrocities that reveal a sinister truth behind this seemingly fresh company.



Will you purify the Internet? Or will you, quite literally, die trying?



Always remember, Chronosoft welcomes you with open arms!
